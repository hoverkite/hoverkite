# Generating power with a kite

Kite has two strings wound on reels connected to motors, which can also act as generators.

1. Steer kite to centre of wind window.
2. Wind pulls the kite, unwinding the string, generating power.
3. Steer kite to edge of wind window.
4. Wind string back in, using less energy than was generated on the way out.
5. Repeat.

---

# Hardware

What hardware do we need?

1. Two motors
2. Spools to wind the strings on
3. Motor controllers
4. A microcontroller and other electronics to manage the motors
5. A big battery to power it all

Let's take the tires off a hoverboard!

# Hoverboard

David bought a "Zinc Smart GT Pro" hoverboard.

These boards have been hacked to make
[DIY mobility devices](https://hackaday.io/project/170932-hoverboards-for-assistive-devices). Their
[firmware](https://github.com/gearsincorg/Hoverboards-for-assistive-devices) is all in C, but served
as useful documentation and inspiration. They also have some
[circuit diagrams and pinouts](https://github.com/gearsincorg/Hoverboards-for-assistive-devices/blob/master/Hoverboard/Documents/Schematic_CoolAndFun.pdf)
which were very useful.

# Hoverboard boards

Each half has an almost-identical "TT-SD2.2" board with:

- A GD32F130C8 microcontroller.
- 6 power MOSFETs to drive the three phase brushless DC motor, and 3 hall effect sensors to sense
  its position.
- A BMI160 6-axis IMU (accelerometer & gyroscope).
- Opto-interruptors to sense someone standing on the hoverboard.
- Two UARTs.
- Some LEDs.
- Battery voltage measurement.
- Motor current measurement.
- A power button.
- An (unpopulated) SWD header.

One half also has a piezo speaker, a battery charger connection, and a Bluetooth module. The only
connections between the two halves are power, and a serial connection between the UARTs for
communication.

# Hardware hacking

We removed the tires from the hoverboard wheels so they could serve as spools, and soldered headers
onto the SWD port and second serial port.

Connect an ST-Link V2 SWD debugger, and we're in! First step, disable the watchdog timer:

```sh
openocd -f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f target/stm32f1x.cfg -c init \
  -c "reset halt; stm32f1x options_write 0 SWWDG"
```

A USB serial adapter is handy too.

We stuck some tape on the piezo speaker as it was too loud.

# Time to write some firmware

It would be easiest to write it in C with PlatformIO and the official GigaDevices headers, based on
the existing assistive devices code we found...

--

Let's not do that.

# Embedded Rust

- Peripheral Access Crate: mostly-safe access to memory-mapped peripheral registers, autogenerated
  from CMSIS-SVD files by `svd2rust`.
- HAL crate: higher level wrappers around various peripherals, generally implementing traits from
  `embedded-hal`.

The [`stm32-rs`](https://github.com/stm32-rs/) project has PAC and HAL crates for many STM32
microcontrollers, including [`stm32f1xx-hal`](https://crates.io/crates/stm32f1xx-hal). Let's try
that.

A GD32F130 is almost the same as an STM32F130, right?

--

Nope. Some basic peripherals are more or less the same, but many are significantly different.

---

# Time to write a PAC

Found `GD32F1x0.svd` on GigaDevice's website, along with the
[datasheet](https://www.gigadevice.com.cn/Public/Uploads/uploadfile/files/20230314/GD32F130xxDatasheetRev3.7.pdf)
(79 page PDF) and
[user manual](https://www.gigadevice.com.cn/Public/Uploads/uploadfile/files/20230209/GD32F1x0_User_Manual_EN_Rev3.6.pdf)
(702 page PDF).

Added lots of patches with svdtools, e.g.:

```yaml
"I2C*":
  CTL0:
    SRESET:
      NotReset: [0, "I2C peripheral not under reset"]
      Reset: [1, "I2C peripheral under reset"]
    SALT:
      Release: [0, "SMBA pin released high"]
      Drive: [1, "SMBA pin driven low"]
    PECTRANS:
      Disabled: [0, "No PEC transfer"]
      Enabled: [1, "PEC transfer"]
  SADDR1:
    ADDRESS2: [0, 0x7F]
    DUADEN:
      Single: [0, "Single addressing mode"]
      Dual: [1, "Dual addressing mode"]
```

Released [`gd32f1`](https://crates.io/crates/gd32f1), supporting GD32F130, FD32F150, GD32F170 and
GD32F190.

???

User manual documents all the peripherals and their registers. The SVD file has some of the same
information (namely the addresses of registers and field names), but has some mistakes and is
missing many details (e.g. enum variant names, valid ranges for values). Adding these in results in
a more usable generated PAC crate. Lots of tedious reading of user manual to write patches for
peripherals I care about. The snippet above is a small part of the patch for the I2C peripherals.

Initially tried sending patches to add support for the GD32F1x0 this to the existing `stm32-rs`
project, but they said it was out of scope. Instead forked to new
[gd32-rs](https://github.com/gd32-rust/gd32-rs) repository, keeping their setup for building and
testing crates, and generating a bunch of useful [HTML pages](https://gd32-rust.github.io/gd32-rs/).

The datasheet has pinouts and specifications (RAM and flash size, numbers of various peripherals)
for all the different variants of the GD32F130 family, along with packaging and electrical
characteristics. GD32F150 and so on have their own datasheets.

# HAL time

Forked from `stm32f1xx-hal`, as some peripherals are similar.

```rust
use crate::{pac::FWDGT, time::MilliSeconds};
use embedded_hal::watchdog::{Watchdog, WatchdogEnable};

pub struct FreeWatchdog {
  fwdgt: FWDGT,
}

impl WatchdogEnable for FreeWatchdog {
  type Time = MilliSeconds;

  fn start<T: Into<Self::Time>>(&mut self, period: T) {
    self.setup(period.into().0);

    self.fwdgt.ctl.write(|w| w.cmd().start());
  }
}

impl Watchdog for FreeWatchdog {
  fn feed(&mut self) {
    self.fwdgt.ctl.write(|w| w.cmd().reset());
  }
}
```

???

- Free watchdog timer: this is probably the simplest module of the HAL.
- Watchdog will reset the MCU if it is not fed for more than the given period of time.
- `FWDGT` is the free watchdog peripheral from the PAC, which gives us access to the registers.
- Taking ownership of `FWDGT` gives us unique access to the peripheral registers, as the PAC only
  allows one instance of each peripheral to exist. (It doesn't implement `Clone`.)
- I've omitted `FreeWatchdog::setup` and some other methods which were too long to fit on the slide.
- Type state pattern is used a fair bit for setting up peripherals.
- Lots of (declarative) macros, for similar types and implementations where generics don't work.
