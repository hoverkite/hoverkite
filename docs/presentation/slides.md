# Generating power with a kite

Kite has two strings wound on reels connected to motors, which can also act as generators.

1. Steer kite to centre of wind window.
2. Wind pulls the kite, unwinding the string, generating power.
3. Steer kite to edge of wind window.
4. Wind string back in, using less energy than was generated on the way out.
5. Repeat.
